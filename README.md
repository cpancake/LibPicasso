LibPicasso
==========
LibPicasso is a fully managed C# image loading library. Think DevIL, but for C#. Great for OpenTK projects.

Current Formats
---------------
* PNM (PPM, PGM, PBM, both Binary and ASCII)
* JPEG
* PNG
* TIFF
* BMP
* GIF

Format Roadmap
--------------
* DirectDraw Surface (.dds)
* Animated GIF (.gif)
* Windows Icon (.ico)
* Interleaved Bitmap (.iff)
* JPEG-2000 (.jpf and many more)
* Animated PNG (.png)
* Targa (.tga)
* Valve Texture (.vtf)
* WebP (.webp)

Issues
------
* Binary PBM doesn't work. I don't know why and the amount of people who will use it is too small to justify trying to figure out why.
